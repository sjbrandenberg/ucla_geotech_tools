# ucla_geotech_tools
Collection of tools developed by the UCLA geotechnical research group. The tools are:

1. ipyconsol: A nonlinear one-dimensional consolidation solver including a state-based secondary compression formulation
2. random_field: Generates densely-sampled two-dimensional spatially correlated random fields using a mix of Cholesky decomposition and ordinary kriging
3. response_spectrum: Computes pseudo-acceleration response spectra for an array of input acceleration time series
4. auto_fchp: Selects high-pass corner frequency for ground motion processing
5. eas: Computes effective amplitude spectrum from two orthogonal horizontal ground motions
